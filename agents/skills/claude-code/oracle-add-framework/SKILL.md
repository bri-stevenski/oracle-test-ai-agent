# Oracle: Add Framework

> Add a new testing framework to Oracle's registry end-to-end. Confirms the classifier↔registry contract, authors the registry entry, validates the execution command, and ensures every classifier `test_type` still resolves to a non-null framework.

## When to Use

- When the user asks to add support for a new framework ("add k6", "support cypress", "we need Locust")
- When a classifier `test_type` exists but has no framework backing it (registry gap)
- When migrating from a deprecated framework — adding the new entry before removing the old one
- NOT for choosing between existing frameworks at runtime — that's the recommender's job
- NOT for adding a one-off LLM-generated framework name that doesn't exist as a real tool — frameworks must be real, runnable CLIs

## Process

### Phase 1: SCOPE — Confirm the Framework Belongs in the Registry

1. **Verify the framework is real and installable.** It needs a runnable CLI invocation (the `execution_command` template). If you can't write a one-line shell command that runs a single test file, it doesn't fit Oracle's model.
2. **Identify the category.** Match to an existing `category` value (`e2e_ui`, `python_unit`, `api`, `performance`, `frontend_unit`, etc.). New categories require a coordinated classifier update — see Phase 2.
3. **Check for overlap.** Is there already a `preferred` framework in this category? If yes, decide intentionally: is the new framework a replacement (demote the old to `legacy`), a peer (add as `supported`), or the new preference (demote the old, mark new as `preferred`)?
4. **Confirm the user wants this maintained.** Each registry entry is a maintenance commitment. A framework added casually but never validated rots into a routing trap.

### Phase 2: ALIGN — Classifier ↔ Registry Contract

1. **Find the classifier rule that emits this `test_type`.** Open `agent/core/classifier.py` and locate the heuristic block that produces the target category.
2. **If no classifier rule exists for the category:** Add one *before* the registry entry. A framework with no routing path is a dead entry. Add a heuristic that maps natural-language signals (keywords, phrases) to the new `test_type`.
3. **If the category exists but the classifier never emits it confidently:** Strengthen the rule's heuristics. Confidence below 0.7 should trigger a clarification, not a generation.
4. **Run the contract tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_orchestrator.py
   ```
   Every `test_type` the classifier can emit must resolve to ≥1 framework via `get_by_category` — the orchestrator tests assert non-null framework resolution per category. This is the gate.

### Phase 3: AUTHOR — Write the Registry Entry

1. **Open `agent/frameworks/registry.json`.** Add a new object to `frameworks[]`. Required fields:
   - `name` (unique slug)
   - `display_name`
   - `category` (must match the classifier emission)
   - `languages`
   - `file_extensions`
   - `execution_command` (with `{file}` placeholder)
   - `status` (`preferred` / `supported` / `legacy`)
2. **Add recommended metadata.** `maturity`, `community_size`, `recommended_for`, `strengths`, `avoid_when`, `ecosystems`. These show up in the recommender's reasoning string — sparse entries produce sparse recommendations.
3. **Validate the `execution_command`.** It must run a single test file when `{file}` is substituted. Test manually:
   ```bash
   echo '<minimal test>' > /tmp/sample.<ext>
   <execution_command with /tmp/sample.<ext> substituted>
   ```
   Confirm exit code 0 (or expected non-zero) and no missing-config errors.
4. **Confirm the `{file}` placeholder is the only substitution.** The executor tokenizes the template with `shlex.split` before substituting `{file}`, so the file path stays a single argv element; paths with spaces must remain intact.

### Phase 4: VERIFY — Generate, Execute, Promote-Dry

1. **Generate a test that should route to the new framework:**
   ```bash
   python -m agent.cli generate "<prompt that should hit the new test_type>"
   ```
2. **Check the trace.** Classification matches the expected category, recommendation picks the new framework (or the existing preferred — confirm this matches your intent), output file has the right extension.
3. **Execute with `--execute`.** Confirm the framework's CLI actually runs the generated file. A passing execution validates the `execution_command` template under the real Oracle invocation path.
4. **Don't promote.** This is a registry-validation run, not a real test promotion. Leave the artifact in `tests/generated/`.

### Phase 5: DOCUMENT — Update Guides and State

1. **Update `docs/guides/framework-registry.md`** if you added a new category, changed the contract surface, or introduced a new optional field schema.
2. **Update the LLM-providers guide** if the new framework only works with specific provider output styles (rare; flag this as a smell if it's true).
3. **Log to `docs/ORACLE_STATE.md`.** One line: framework name, category, status, date added. This is the project ledger; future maintainers grep here first.
4. **Open a PR.** Title: `feat(registry): add <framework-name> support`. Body should include the validation steps you ran and the generated/executed sample.

## Oracle Integration

- **`agent/frameworks/registry.json`** — Source of truth for entries.
- **`agent/core/framework_registry.py`** — Loader and lookup methods. Don't add lookup helpers here unless the existing five (`get_all_frameworks`, `get_by_category`, `get_preferred_by_category`, `find_by_name`, `match_by_language`) genuinely don't fit.
- **`agent/core/classifier.py`** — Routing rules. Coordinate changes with registry entries.
- **`tests/unit/test_orchestrator.py`** — Contract enforcement. Non-null resolution per `test_type` (api → pytest, e2e_ui → playwright, performance → k6, etc.) is asserted here. `tests/unit/test_factory.py` separately enforces the LLM provider matrix.

## Success Criteria

- New entry validates against the contract test (no orphaned `test_type` in classifier, no null framework resolution in registry)
- `python -m agent.cli generate "<routing prompt>"` resolves to the new framework
- `--execute` runs the generated file successfully via the new `execution_command`
- `framework-registry.md` documents any new category or schema field
- `ORACLE_STATE.md` ledger entry is present
- PR includes the validation transcript

## Rationalizations to Reject

| Rationalization | Why It Is Wrong |
| --- | --- |
| "I'll add the registry entry now and update the classifier later" | Orphaned registry entries are routing traps. Either both land together or neither does. |
| "Marking it `preferred` is fine, no need to demote the existing entry" | Multiple `preferred` entries in one category means `get_preferred_by_category` picks by registry order, not by merit. Demote the loser explicitly. |
| "I tested the command with my path — Oracle's substitution will work too" | Test the substituted command with a path that contains spaces. The executor's `shlex.split`-then-substitute order exists specifically to handle this case; a broken template will silently corrupt argv. |
| "It only needs to work for the happy-path prompt I tried" | If the classifier emits this `test_type` with confidence ≥0.7 for *any* phrasing, the framework must handle the resulting generated file. Test at least two distinct prompts that route to the new entry. |
| "Sparse metadata is fine, we can fill it in later" | The recommender's reasoning string is read by humans and agents. Sparse metadata produces unhelpful recommendations — fill it in now while you have the context. |

## Examples

### Example: Adding Cypress as a peer to Playwright

**Scope:** Cypress already has community demand and a CI image. Category `e2e_ui` already has Playwright as `preferred`. Decision: add Cypress as `supported`, keep Playwright as `preferred`.

**Classifier:** Already emits `test_type=e2e_ui` on UI-test prompts. No classifier change needed.

**Entry (abridged):**
```json
{
  "name": "cypress",
  "display_name": "Cypress",
  "category": "e2e_ui",
  "languages": ["javascript", "typescript"],
  "file_extensions": ["cy.ts", "cy.js"],
  "execution_command": "npx --yes cypress run --spec {file}",
  "status": "supported",
  "strengths": ["Time-travel debugging", "Strong DX for UI tests"],
  "avoid_when": ["Cross-browser parity required (Playwright is stronger)"]
}
```

**Validation:** Generated a UI test prompt, confirmed recommender still picked Playwright (correct — `preferred` wins). Verified Cypress is accessible by routing a prompt with explicit Cypress mention through a future explicit-framework override.

### Example: Adding k6 to a new performance category

**Scope:** Performance category doesn't exist in the registry yet. Classifier emits `test_type=performance` on load/stress prompts, but the registry has no matching entry — this is the orphan case.

**Phase 2 first:** Confirmed `agent/core/classifier.py` already has the performance rule (`if "performance" in p or "load test" in p ...`). No classifier change needed.

**Phase 3:**
```json
{
  "name": "k6",
  "display_name": "k6",
  "category": "performance",
  "languages": ["javascript"],
  "file_extensions": ["js"],
  "execution_command": "k6 run {file}",
  "status": "preferred",
  "recommended_for": ["HTTP load testing", "Stress and spike tests"],
  "avoid_when": ["Browser-level performance (use Playwright tracing)"]
}
```

**Validation:** `python -m agent.cli generate "Load test /v1/search at 200 RPS for 5 minutes" --execute`. Confirmed classifier emits `test_type=performance` at 0.95 confidence, recommender picks k6, k6 CLI runs the generated file without error.

## Escalation

- **When the framework requires a non-trivial config file (e.g., `playwright.config.ts`):** Document the setup in `avoid_when` or in `recommended_for`. If Oracle is expected to generate the config too, that's a scaffolder change, not just a registry change.
- **When two frameworks legitimately should both be `preferred` for different sub-cases:** Split the category. A single category should have a single `preferred`. If the split isn't clean, surface this to the user as a design decision rather than fudging the registry.
- **When the classifier doesn't reliably emit the target `test_type`:** Don't add the registry entry yet. Strengthen the classifier first — an unreachable entry is dead weight.
- **When the framework's CLI doesn't accept a single-file argument:** Oracle's model is one-test-per-file generation. Frameworks that only run by directory or by tag don't fit cleanly; raise this with the user before forcing a workaround.
