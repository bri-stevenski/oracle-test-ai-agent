# Claude Code — Project Instructions

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for full project context, architecture, and conventions.

## Branch Hygiene

Before making any code changes, check the current branch with `git branch --show-current`.

If on `main`:
- Do not start writing or modifying code yet.
- Propose a branch name using the convention in AGENTS.md (`<prefix>/<kebab-case-slug>`).
- Ask: *"You're on `main`. Should I create branch `<suggested-name>` for this work?"*
- Wait for confirmation, then create and switch to the branch before proceeding.

Documentation-only commits (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) may land on `main` directly unless the user says otherwise.
